## Change server
To change to a local server (e.g. for testing), find the two objects called 'fetchAPI' at the top of script.js and comment out the one with cloud connections while removing comments from the one connection to localhost and vice versa to change from localhost to cloud connection.

Make sure the backend server is started before running frontend locally.
